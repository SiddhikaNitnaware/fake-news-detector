# Fake News Detection using NLP

This project is a machine learning system that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## How It Works

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords)
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Logistic Regression classifier
 
## Performance

The model achieves approximately 98% accuracy on the test dataset.

## How to Run

### Train the model
cd src
python train_model.py

### Predict news
cd src
python predict.py
